# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio! This repository is a collection of various machine learning projects that showcase different techniques and algorithms. Below you'll find a brief overview of each project, along with instructions on how to navigate the projects and run the code.

## Projects

### Project 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Directory**: `KNN/`
- **Description**: An exploration of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm applied to a dataset to solve a classification or regression problem.
- **Contents**:
  - `data/`: The dataset(s) used for the project.
  - `knn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the detailed walkthrough of the KNN implementation and analysis.
  - `knn.py`: The Python script version of the notebook for easy execution.

### Project 2: Perceptron

- **Directory**: `Perceptron/`
- **Description**: Implementation of the Perceptron algorithm and its application to a binary classification problem.
- **Contents**:
  - `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing experiments and results with the Perceptron model.
  - `perceptron.py`: The core Python script that implements the Perceptron algorithm.

### Project 3: Ridge Regression

- **Directory**: `Ridge/`
- **Description**: An investigation into Ridge Regression, showcasing its ability to deal with multicollinearity by introducing a regularization parameter.
- **Contents**:
  - `olympics_100m.csv`: Dataset containing 100m sprint times used for regression analysis.
  - `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook documenting the Ridge Regression experiments and findings.
  - `Ridge.py`: Python script implementing Ridge Regression.
