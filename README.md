In this repo I tried (my best) to organize some of the projects I have been working on during the Machine learning and intelligent systems course thaught at EURECOM. The first folder does not include any report and the notebook isn't well organized, but the hyperparameter thuning part is there.
## Projects

### Project 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Directory**: `KNN/`
- **Description**: An exploration of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm applied to a dataset to solve a classification or regression problem.
- **Contents**:
  - `data/`: The dataset(s) used for the project.
  - `knn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the detailed walkthrough of the KNN implementation and analysis.
  - `knn.py`: The Python script version of the notebook for easy execution.

### Project 2: Perceptron

- **Directory**: `Perceptron/`
- **Description**: Implementation of the Perceptron algorithm and its application to a binary classification problem.
- **Contents**:
  - `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing experiments and results with the Perceptron model.
  - `perceptron.py`: The core Python script that implements the Perceptron algorithm.

### Project 3: Ridge Regression

- **Directory**: `Ridge/`
- **Description**: An investigation into Ridge Regression, showcasing its ability to deal with multicollinearity by introducing a regularization parameter.
- **Contents**:
  - `olympics_100m.csv`: Dataset containing 100m sprint times used for regression analysis.
  - `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook documenting the Ridge Regression experiments and findings.
  - `Ridge.py`: Python script implementing Ridge Regression.
